Join the LWM Community's Discord server and go to "INITIATIVES" Category and then go to "#ml-ai-deep-learning" channel to get access to Google Docs with all the course links and Accounts and passwords.


Also, we have a Google Excel sheet. If you are dedicated enough, you will surely write 51 blogs properly.

You can add your name and then complete 51 blogs gradually and share the link here.



# Writing Blogs
You can write yours blogs at Dev.to: https://dev.to/ (My suggestion is to write in Dev.to)

Also, you can use Medium. Do you know one interesting fact?
One of our Alumni : Imran Sefat (@ImranSefat) vaia got 2 Remote job at Australia . So, it's up to you know. 


# How to learn and post?
Each week, you will learn a different topic mentioned above. Follow the Google Docs Shared in the LWM Community's server. Use the accounts mentioned to get full access to courses. Write blogs when you are learning the topic.

For example, check my blogs: 
Docker series (Part 10) : Create your own Dockerfile and create a container from it: https://dev.to/mitul3737/docker-series-part-10-create-your-own-dockerfile-and-create-a-container-from-it-2b73

As this is a ML. AI, Deep Learning , NLP initiative, must post on linkedIn with the hashtag #ml_with_mitul


# Use Hashtag while posting on LinkedIn and Twitter

After writing a blog, make sure to post on linkedin using the hash tag #ml_with_mitul.



# What next?
After you complete all of the topics, we will get into Kaggle Projects and Competitions. 


Best wishes for you awesome journey 😉
